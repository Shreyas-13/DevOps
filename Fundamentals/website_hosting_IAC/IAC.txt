This branch of DevOps project only contains the web hosting project but in IAC (Infra as Code) format.
The commands are added in the shell section of the vagrant file so when the machine goes up the Apache server starts automatically.

The HTML file is downloaded and moved to /var/www/html and the server restarts post that. 
This automates the process of creating and deploying websites on Apache server.
